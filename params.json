{"name":"TextEditor","tagline":"A simple text editor for the Nokia N9.","body":"![TextEditor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6352990/11638945/4e0d3c48-9d32-11e5-8678-ade3cb12dd8c.png)**TextEditor** is a simple text editor application for the Nokia N9 phone. It includes a minimalistic file browser for opening and saving files (currently there is no support for hidden files). \r\n\r\nThe application is released under the GPL3 license and the source codes are available on Github.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTextEditor is available in [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/n9dyfi/texteditor). You can use the OpenRepos [Warehouse](https://openrepos.net/content/basil/warehouse) tool to install the application.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe figure below shows the edit view. The title bar displays the file name and the folder name. The bottom toolbar contains a quick save button and the file menu.\r\n![texteditor-01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6352990/11677112/c2b15320-9e42-11e5-8b64-6fc68e32c079.png)\r\nThe file menu contains entries for opening a new file, opening an existing file and saving a file with a new name. Clicking About will display the application version and Quit will terminate the application. Swiping down will also terminate the application but in that case no warning will be issued for possible unsaved modifications.\r\n![texteditor-02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6352990/11666119/8277a48e-9df3-11e5-8d7f-ce2cc35406a9.png)\r\nClicking File>Open will open the file browser for selecting a file to edit. Clicking a folder in the browser will open that folder. The back button in the toolbar will go back to the previous folder. The refresh button will reload the folder contents. The toolbar menu can be used to cancel the browsing and go back to the editor.\r\n![texteditor-03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6352990/11677001/7048b2c8-9e41-11e5-8962-8fd3f81fdffc.png)\r\nTo save the file with a new name select \"Save As\" from the File menu. The file browser will open. Select the target folder and write the file name to the text box above the browser window. Then either click enter in the keyboard or click the Save button in the title bar.\r\n![texteditor-04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6352990/11667914/238a0174-9dfd-11e5-9859-6022c418364b.png)\r\n### Getting the source code\r\nYou can download the source code for the TextEditor from [Github](https://github.com/n9dyfi/TextEditor.git).

Just start QtCreator and select Create Projectâ€¦>Project from Version Control>Git Repository Clone. The Clone URL is https://github.com/n9dyfi/TextEditor.git.

Go to the [TextEditor project](https://www.transifex.com/n9dyfi/texteditor/).\r\n3. Request a translation for the english language file tr_en.ts. Wait for confirmation.\r\n4.
